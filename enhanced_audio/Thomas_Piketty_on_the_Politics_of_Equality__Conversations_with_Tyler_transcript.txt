[3.54 - 7.18] Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
[7.64 - 13.00] Today I'm here with Toma Piketty, and he has a new book out, A Brief History of Equality,
[13.34 - 17.28] which in my opinion is the very best introduction to his overall views.
[17.74 - 18.56] Toma, welcome.
[19.50 - 20.70] Thank you for your invitation.
[22.16 - 24.64] Let me start with some questions about France.
[24.64 - 29.04] As you've pointed out yourself, France adopted a progressive income tax,
[29.54 - 31.06] relatively late in its history.
[31.70 - 35.50] Just how egalitarian as a country, do you think France is?
[37.88 - 42.98] , as I stress in my new book, A Brief History of Equality,
[43.64 - 49.56] there's been a long run movement towards more equality in history,
[49.56 - 53.92] and together with a movement towards more prosperity,
[54.30 - 58.88] towards more economic prosperity, and I argue that the two movements really came together.
[60.10 - 61.94] And France is part of this movement.
[62.12 - 65.42] , each country has its own limitations,
[66.34 - 69.76] and its own hypocrisies with equality and inequality,
[70.24 - 76.76] and France has a lot of limitation, lots of hypocrisies in the way to deal with
[76.91 - 82.63] a very unequal access to France and different funding in higher education,
[83.03 - 86.75] or a lot of discrimination that is not addressed.
[87.17 - 91.99] But by and large, if I take a big picture and look in the long run,
[92.93 - 97.91] there's been a movement toward more equality of income, more equality of wealth,
[98.13 - 103.61] more equality in access to political power, more equality in access to education,
[103.97 - 105.89] in else, over the long run.
[105.89 - 108.71] Now, this has not been a steady process.
[109.27 - 112.99] This is the evolution toward more equality that has taken place
[114.13 - 119.39] through political mobilization, social struggles, and it starts in the
[119.39 - 125.47] the story, I'm telling you, it's a story where the movement toward more equality starts
[126.21 - 131.35] at the end of the 18th century., typically, in the case of France with the French
[131.35 - 135.09] Revolution, the abolition of aristocratic privileges,
[136.35 - 141.29] the slave revolt also in Sandermag, which,, these two events,
[141.59 - 147.37] , the abolition of aristocratic privileges and the slave revolt in Sandermag
[148.47 - 155.31] are the beginning of the end of aristocratic societies, societies based on privileges,
[156.71 - 163.05] and slave and colonial societies and the other hand.But you can see very,,
[163.17 - 168.21] how these two movements, these two evolution toward more equality,, are not over.
[168.47 - 173.31] They continued during the 19th century, 20th century, with,,
[173.47 - 179.19] the end of slavery, the end of colonialism, the rise of social security, the rise of progressive
[179.19 - 186.15] taxation.But in France, just in the US,, there is still a lot of discrimination today,
[186.45 - 191.03] , there is still a lot of gender inequality today, there is still a lot of political
[191.79 - 196.09] inequality,, in access to voice, access to participation, political power,
[196.73 - 202.09] there's still a enormous concentration of wealth,, to some extent it's just increased,
[202.85 - 208.53] especially in the US in recent decades, less in France or in Europe.,, in the long
[208.53 - 213.29] year,, there's a movement about more equality, but,, I'm not saying this to
[213.29 - 219.29] conclude that,, everything is great and,, we should just stay we are.I'm saying
[219.29 - 227.23] this,, in order also to suggest that,, this movement called and should continue.
[227.61 - 233.05] And I think it will continue, because in the end, this is a way to address some of the biggest
[234.11 - 240.17] challenges that we have to address., let me ask you just a very specific question.,
[240.25 - 245.81] it's a common American perception of France and maybe Paris in particular that there are relatively
[245.81 - 251.99] few dimensions of status competition.One is supposed to address a certain way or have particular
[251.99 - 257.71] habits of cultural consumption and that thus along the dimension of cultural status,
[258.35 - 264.67] France and Paris are especially in the Galitarian.That was someone from France and nearby Paris,
[265.05 - 268.97] just what's your impression of that portrait of your own country?Is it misleading?
[269.77 - 273.75] Or you have to tell me that again., what's exactly your comparison?You're making between Paris
[273.75 - 279.05] and New York, for instance, or...If you compared Paris to New York or even Paris to Berlin,
[279.75 - 285.49] an impression that many outsiders have is there are relatively few dimensions of status competition.
[285.49 - 289.09] , there's the civil service.There's a certain notion of doing in business.
[289.79 - 294.65] The number of ways you could be expected to address and be considered to be -dressed,
[295.09 - 300.85] that seems fairly circumscribed in Paris.But somewhere Berlin, there seem to be many more
[300.85 - 307.69] open dimensions of status competition or in New York City.Do you think in this particular way
[307.69 - 310.67] Parisian life is especially any Galitarian?
[312.97 - 317.89] , I have never thought about this, but maybe you're.I have never heard of this,
[318.05 - 325.39] it's true, but you're saying the diversity of dress of dressing code is less
[326.19 - 331.21] extensive in Paris and Berlin of New York, that's...But not just dress.You could look at cuisine,
[331.87 - 337.05] you could look at the status, say, of tech nerds in Berlin or New York relative to France,
[340.27 - 345.75] okay, maybe that's, maybe that's wrong.I don't know what symmetry calls this.
[349.61 - 353.65] Yeah, I'm not sure, frankly, I never thought of that, be sure.
[354.79 - 359.67] Let me try another question.For someone trying to place you in French intellectual history,
[360.03 - 365.69] let's say they're not an economist and they want to know which traditions from the French left
[365.69 - 372.89] are you closest to?Would it be utopian socialists, critical theorists, subjective Marxists, 1968
[372.89 - 376.15] crowd?Where do you place yourself in your own countries?
[376.47 - 381.79] , okay, this I can answer more precisely.I would say first none of the above,
[382.37 - 388.23] I would put myself more in the tradition of the analysis school.I don't know if this
[388.23 - 394.55] rings a bell for you or not, but there's a tradition of research in social and economic history
[395.27 - 405.63] that was particularly active in France, I would say, between the 1930s and 1980s with people
[406.47 - 414.49] Brodell or Labrouss, and in a way, and these are people who have started working on the
[414.49 - 421.43] history of the distribution of wages for instance during the 18th century, in the period going
[421.43 - 426.47] to the French Revolution, is the French Revolution viewed to the fact that wages were lagging behind
[428.53 - 432.41] land grant, that was one of the big questions that these people were asking.
[434.01 - 439.83] In a way, what I've been doing is to try to pursue this tradition in social and economic
[439.83 - 446.33] history, we also strong influence from Anglo-Saxon research in this area,
[446.33 - 453.59] Cursnets, Atkinson, and, there's a long tradition also of British and US
[455.19 - 459.95] historians and economists and social scientists trying to collect this
[461.45 - 472.23] income and history.That's what I've been doing., yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I don't feel very close
[472.23 - 481.65] to the philosophical or political sort tradition you are referring to because my work
[482.23 - 490.75] has mostly consisted of trying to collect these historical data sources, and then of course
[490.75 - 495.95] to propose some interpretation of these data sources, but I feel I've always been very close
[495.95 - 504.19] to my sources, or, this is what has been,, kept me busy,, 95% of my time
[504.83 - 511.67] for the past 25 years or.When I read Brodell, it strikes me there's something quite
[511.67 - 515.81] conservative about the argument.I don't mean politically conservative, but
[515.81 - 521.97] conservative.The sense of long structures stretching through decades or even centuries.
[522.99 - 527.53] Do you share that with him or do you think in some way you deviate that makes you more political?
[527.57 - 532.03] Okay.Okay, you're., I don't know if this makes more political or
[532.03 - 536.83] theoretical, but I, you're perfectly that,, one big difference between the work I've
[536.83 - 542.59] been doing and the work people Brodell or La Brose were doing is that,, I add to
[542.59 - 549.33] deal a lot with the 20th century, whereas most,, these people were working a lot on
[549.33 - 554.65] previous centuries,, 18th century, 19th century, or even before in the case of Brodell.
[555.45 - 563.57] And working on the 20th century data and in particular,, the enormous reduction
[564.37 - 571.89] of income inequality during the 20th century,, led me to a different perspective
[571.89 - 578.51] and a different thinking and issues.To be very precise,, the political dimension,
[580.79 - 587.47] is much more important in a way, an avoidable and impossible to escape when you study
[587.47 - 593.97] the 20th century.When you study the 18th century or 19th century or maybe you can have this,
[595.97 - 602.77] , Marxist or economic perspective,, stressing the long run,
[602.77 - 609.85] evolution, deterministic economic forces.When you study the 20th century,
[611.21 - 615.29] , the politics is everywhere because,, one, one, one, one, two,
[615.53 - 622.05] the great depression, the creation of social security systems, the development of progressive
[622.05 - 629.65] taxation, decolonization and of a part of your, politics is everywhere if you want to understand
[629.65 - 636.23] the evolution of inequality.I would say it's also to some extent the same for the 19th century and,
[636.33 - 641.15] , the end of the 18th century, I talk about the French Revolution and the slave revolting
[641.15 - 648.45] Sandoman, I think,, the history of equality or inequality cannot just be an economic
[648.45 - 655.45] history.It has to be a political history because if you want to account for what you see,
[656.35 - 661.47] if you want to explain what you see, it's,, political processes,
[662.39 - 669.49] sometimes revolutions, sometimes tax reforms, sometimes,, political confrontation of
[669.49 - 677.31] all sorts, play a major role.,, I had to develop this perspective and indeed,
[677.51 - 681.37] this is a big difference with the analysis school,, the analysis school in a way where
[681.37 - 689.47] did not disappear before reaching the 20th century,, the heaths, they were not
[689.47 - 698.49] confronted to the same issues that I was confronted just because I write later than
[698.49 - 707.25] them with data covering the more recent period.And,, I had to develop a different
[708.11 - 715.93] perspective in a different interpretation.Yes, stressing the role of politics and political
[715.93 - 723.33] institution and fiscal institution, social institution and the.As, there's a
[723.33 - 729.53] competing, longer-rate tradition.If you look at the work of Greg Clark and Neil Cummins on surnames,
[729.73 - 735.19] they take data from England, from Sweden.There's one paper where they have about almost eight
[735.19 - 741.03] centuries of data, I think.And social status is more heritable than height.A given status
[741.03 - 747.77] relationship has persistence for 15 or 20 generations.What do you think of that work?And do you think
[747.77 - 753.61] it's a perspective that contrasts to yours and shows it's really very hard to redistribute what
[753.61 - 759.75] really matters in society?Look, this is very interesting.Every time there is a lot of
[759.75 - 764.79] historical data collection, I am very interested.And, this is very interesting work.
[765.59 - 772.65] That being said, I find the perspective a bit too conservative in a way and a bit too,
[773.29 - 780.69] maybe because it's very long run.But again, if I look, my period of study is the period ranging
[780.69 - 789.17] from the end of the 18th century until today., this is 1780, 2020, 21.And over this two
[789.17 - 798.79] centuries and a half, what I see is a movement to have more equality, both in terms of political rights,
[799.07 - 807.77] but also in terms of social and economic equality.And what I argue is that this process is very
[807.77 - 817.01] much related to political development, political revolution, slave revolt, wars of independence,
[817.01 - 825.31] tax reform, changing balance of power between capital and labor, development of social security,
[825.81 - 832.33] development of public school system or public health system.And over this period,
[833.35 - 839.07] this has led to very strong movement toward more equality in all these dimensions,
[839.07 - 846.59] and also toward more economic prosperity.And I stress this.Now, before this period,
[848.09 - 856.15] I am aware that there are people Gail Clark and others who stress the continuity across
[857.23 - 865.35] eight centuries of perpetuation of state-use inequality.There are also historians Shider,
[866.23 - 871.81] going back to the Neolithic period or to ancient history, who stress,
[875.73 - 880.21] relatively pessimistic, with a relatively pessimistic perspective, in the sense that they say,
[880.31 - 886.95] OK, without major destruction or war, you never have a reduction of inequality.
[888.55 - 892.95] All this work is very interesting, but the perspective I stress is a bit different.
[892.95 - 900.03] I think it's more optimistic in a way.Because I think if you look at this shorter period,
[900.23 - 908.57] which is still very long, two century and half, 17, 18, 2020, you see this political movement
[908.57 - 915.89] toward more equality.To be honest, I must admit, I must confess that I am always a bit skeptical
[915.89 - 925.51] of some of the data sources before the late 18th century.Partly because I know them less,
[925.67 - 933.35] I feel less confident with them.Partly because when I don't have a sunsuse,
[933.63 - 940.67] when I don't have a tax administration, when I don't even know the population that is out there
[940.67 - 947.91] and how it is changing over time, I find it very, very difficult to say, did the concentration
[947.91 - 956.81] of wealth increase in Europe between 1550 and 1750?Let alone the question of did it increase
[956.81 - 963.41] between the end of the Roman Empire and 1500?I don't know the answer to this question.
[963.75 - 969.15] I also suspect concentration of wealth inequality was always pretty large in this
[970.45 - 977.97] 318th century period.But from what I read and I tried to read carefully most of what is written
[977.97 - 985.87] on this topic, I'm not sure we have the data sources to really answer these questions,
[985.87 - 996.71] unfortunately.This is why I'm a bit...This is why I try to focus on the more recent period,
[996.71 - 1002.49] and which is still very long.If I look at Trans in the early 1960s, as,
[1002.89 - 1006.79] the rate of finishing or even starting higher education is extremely low,
[1007.17 - 1012.49] but Trans is doing fine.Do you view that as evidence for the view that it's really
[1012.49 - 1019.23] the continuity of cultural capital that matters and not much policy?Oh no because there's been
[1019.23 - 1027.79] huge educational expansion since then.Between 1950 and 1990 until today,
[1028.45 - 1033.17] educational expansion in France and throughout Europe and most of the world,
[1033.35 - 1044.09] for that was being considerable.In the 1950s France, but to a large extent Western Europe,
[1044.09 - 1052.63] is lagging behind the US in terms of educational achievement.To me, it's clear that the key reason
[1052.63 - 1060.59] why the US has been an economic leader at the world level for most of the 20th century is because
[1060.59 - 1068.17] it was an educational leader.In the 1950s, as, very, you have 90% of a generation going
[1068.17 - 1076.15] to high school in the US, whereas in France or in Germany, it's 20 to 30% of a generation.
[1076.37 - 1085.09] And you need to wait until the 1980s or 90s to reach the same 90% of a cohort going to
[1085.09 - 1091.39] high school and to have a universal access to it.And it was the same.In the 19th century,
[1092.35 - 1100.63] the US reached 90% primary school attendance rate almost a century before Europe, or at least
[1100.63 - 1108.61] alpha-sumptory or two-third of a century before Europe.And I think this was a key explanation
[1108.61 - 1117.09] where economic productivity was much higher in the United States.But I think here policy
[1117.09 - 1123.55] made a big difference., especially after World War II, there was an enormous educational push
[1124.61 - 1132.75] not only in France and Germany, but also in Japan and then other countries in Asia also
[1133.73 - 1139.81] followed this push.And this has completely transformed the economic geography and the geography
[1139.81 - 1147.13] of productivity.And the huge advance that the US had in the middle of the 20th century to a large
[1147.13 - 1156.57] extent as it appeared today.And I think policies, institutions played a major role in this
[1156.57 - 1166.49] dynamics with specific political and social history in the different countries.And of course,
[1166.49 - 1173.21] it's not only politics is also the product of the belief system and the perceptions that families
[1173.21 - 1180.99] are about education, about the culture of education., all these different dimensions have to be
[1180.99 - 1189.03] have to be studied together.As, Matt Ronley and a number of other researchers have argued
[1189.03 - 1194.15] the relevant increase in wealth inequality really is centered in real estate and housing wealth.
[1194.87 - 1200.57] Do you agree?And if, isn't it enough just to be a georgist?Can't we just do the redistribution there?
[1202.17 - 1208.03] , but if you look at the top of the West's distribution, I don't see a lot of real estate.
[1208.43 - 1214.63] If you look at that, I don't think Matt Ronley or anyone who is saying that the U-Drize in
[1214.63 - 1220.41] billionaire wealth since the US has anything to do with real estate, as far as I know, nobody has
[1220.41 - 1226.01] tried to put this theory on the table., I'm not saying real estate is not important.I
[1226.01 - 1231.45] think for middle-class assets and lower middle-class and upper middle-class assets, for the middle
[1231.45 - 1236.81] of the distribution, real estate is of course very important and the movement in real estate prices
[1236.81 - 1243.81] explain a lot of what's going on both in terms of aggregate value distribution., I'm not saying
[1243.81 - 1251.73] it's not important.It is very important and if you go back to our paper with Gabriel Zucman,
[1251.89 - 1256.67] which was published now almost 10 years ago in the quarterly journal of economics in 2014,
[1256.89 - 1264.07] called Capitalist Back Wells income ratio in the long run 1700, 2010, you will see we have
[1264.07 - 1270.81] complete the composition about the role of real estate in aggregate wealth accumulation and
[1271.71 - 1277.29] it's absolutely central for many countries or the many styles, there's no.We cannot
[1277.29 - 1281.99] have any disagreement on that because this is our data, this is what we did almost 10 years ago.
[1283.63 - 1287.99] But that's not going to explain for example what happens at the top of the distribution,
[1288.47 - 1294.09] because real estate is absolutely negligible when you look at the billionaire wealth., you need
[1294.71 - 1299.73] here, you need other stories, yes?But for the distribution overall, it seems there's a lot of
[1299.73 - 1306.01] papers, quite recent, O'Dron Bonnet, Georgia, the Ronelli work, Canole, Feffer and Waitcus,
[1306.61 - 1312.49] they seem to think it's primarily about real estate, if not 100%,, predominantly real estate.
[1312.97 - 1317.73] , you don't agree with their estimates or you just think you're addressing a separate problem
[1317.73 - 1323.49] of billionaire inequality at the top.No, I think it, again, it depends whether you look at aggregate
[1323.49 - 1330.83] wealth or you look at the distribution of wealth.If you look at aggregate wealth, then real estate
[1330.83 - 1337.63] is a really big part of the increase in aggregate wealth to income ratio, especially in Europe.
[1338.47 - 1343.45] Let's say in the US, in the US, the aggregate wealth to income ratio increased much less in Europe.
[1344.01 - 1350.13] But for the aggregate wealth to income ratio, especially in Europe or Japan, real estate is
[1350.13 - 1355.11] the central explanation that there's no doubt about this.Now, if you look at the distribution,
[1356.37 - 1361.65] it's a very different story because in fact,, the increase of the relative price of,
[1361.75 - 1368.89] , real estate asset relative to say stock market prices or financial asset is
[1368.89 - 1374.65] relative good overall for the middle flats as compared to the very top,, because the middle
[1374.65 - 1382.31] class owns mostly real estate and whereas the top owns mostly financial and business asset.,
[1382.91 - 1390.95] if the only force at play was the big increase in real estate price, in fact, wealth inequality
[1390.95 - 1394.87] should have declined.Our top-fuel share should have declined relative to the middle, which,
[1395.25 - 1399.85] , obviously, we see not what we see.And there is some disagreement about the
[1399.85 - 1405.05] magnitude of the increase in top-fuel shares, but nobody is saying that top-fuel shares have been
[1405.05 - 1413.13] declining in recent decades in any country., by definition, real estate, the real estate argument
[1413.13 - 1418.63] is not going to explain what we see for the wealth distribution.And then,, it depends
[1418.63 - 1423.51] what segment of the distribution you are interested, but if you're interested at the top share,
[1424.55 - 1427.55] , if you're interested at the very top,, billionaire wealth, which,,
[1427.55 - 1432.85] after all, is interesting, it's unsafe and it's a non-negligible fraction of total wealth.
[1434.57 - 1438.47] , I think again, nobody is saying that real estate is experiencing this.
[1439.17 - 1442.75] , if you see a paper saying that, please send it to me, but...
[1443.55 - 1449.13] If I look at nominal income data for the US or for that matter, Switzerland, those two countries
[1449.13 - 1455.65] measure as being wealthier than either France or Germany.Do you think citizens in US and Switzerland
[1455.65 - 1458.01] are happier than French and Germans?
[1459.17 - 1466.45] , again, it's important to,, if you're interested in welfare, you need to look at
[1466.45 - 1472.15] productivity.,, that's the first thing., you need to look at GDP per hour of work,
[1472.35 - 1478.37] for income per hour of work.And you probably know very,, if you look at OECD data
[1478.37 - 1483.95] or bureau of labor statistics series in the US, which are almost similar on your stat series,
[1484.61 - 1491.73] everywhere you go to,, you will see that GDP per hour of work is virtually the same
[1492.59 - 1498.93] in US, Germany, France,, it's a few percent different.I'm sure this
[1498.93 - 1505.33] same thing.Sure, sure.Okay., in terms of welfare, of course, as economists,, what matters
[1505.33 - 1509.65] is productivity, not income per se, because, if you have a higher income, just because
[1509.65 - 1516.33] you work longer hours, the effect on welfare is ambiguous,, it depends how you value,
[1517.13 - 1523.45] , leisure, versus work, etc.And,, presumably,, if European countries,
[1523.69 - 1529.57] , decided to have more vacation and a bigger reduction of working times in the US,
[1530.39 - 1535.27] in the 20th century,, it was not the case,, a century ago, in the early 20th
[1535.27 - 1540.27] century working hours were shorter in the US and Europe,, partly because productivity
[1540.27 - 1547.01] was higher, it for working less.But, today, and in the past century, the decline
[1547.01 - 1552.41] in working hours has been bigger in Germany and France,, presumably,, this was a
[1552.41 - 1558.67] choice,, this was a complicated political process, but, it, it,, nobody in Germany
[1558.67 - 1566.49] of France today is proposing to divide by two the number of weeks of vacation and go to the US
[1566.49 - 1577.19] federal law in that respect., in terms of welfare,, my own view, if you,, my
[1577.19 - 1582.41] own view, as you can imagine, is that when you have such, when, when you multiply your
[1582.41 - 1590.45] productivity by 10 over the past century, it makes sense,, to take some of this
[1590.45 - 1596.95] increase in productivity, to have more vacation, to spend more time with your children and family,
[1597.25 - 1603.35] to spend more time traveling around the world, the world, and, for me, for many Europeans,
[1604.09 - 1609.85] the idea of taking only two weeks in vacation over the summer, when you are rich,
[1610.37 - 1617.23] looks one of the most stupid things you can, you can do in life, but, it, look, it's,
[1618.29 - 1622.69] , different,, people can make different choices, of course, of course, in this.
[1623.19 - 1628.63] But if the relationship between wealth and happiness is diffuse, and I would agree it may be,
[1628.91 - 1634.67] I'm happier than some billionaires I know, why worry much about wealth and equality?Why not
[1634.67 - 1638.73] focus on inequality of -being, which could be something quite different?
[1640.07 - 1647.27] Oh, yeah, no,, I care ultimately,, what I care about is,, access to
[1647.27 - 1655.47] fundamental goods education, health, participation,, participation to the political
[1656.19 - 1662.75] life, participation to economic life.Ultimately,, this is what I care about,,
[1663.33 - 1672.17] income and wealth per se,, are just mechanism and tools and ways,, to
[1672.17 - 1679.11] access to go in this direction.But in the end,, what's really important for me,,
[1679.15 - 1689.41] is to have the highest possible opportunities and rights to access fundamental goods
[1691.63 - 1698.33] for everybody.This is all wet metals.But, I see that in Paris, and I tend to think
[1698.33 - 1702.83] it's cultural capital.Rents are very high.There are people who are not huge earners,
[1702.93 - 1707.61] they live in Paris, they enjoy Paris immensely as they should.They have incredible cultural
[1707.61 - 1712.91] capital and many of these smart people they can talk to.They're partaking in those goods,
[1713.13 - 1717.97] yet there's very high wealth and equality in Paris.You teach in London, super high
[1717.97 - 1722.93] wealth and equality in London.You can live there very if you do it smartly.Again,
[1723.07 - 1726.83] why not focus on cultural capital for individuals rather than the wealth?
[1727.85 - 1735.43] Yeah, first I am teaching Paris, I was in London a long time ago, as a student, but I'm not teaching
[1735.43 - 1743.33] there.Yeah,, cultural capital,, is part of what I am interested,,
[1743.33 - 1749.31] when I look at the inequalities in education and access to education, this is about cultural
[1749.31 - 1756.65] capital., when I look at the, I try to understand the changing structure of political
[1756.65 - 1762.51] villages and move votes for whom and which party and coalition, which is a topic and which I
[1762.51 - 1770.43] have been working quite a bit in recent years, cultural inequality and different access to education
[1771.03 - 1779.81] and reversal of education of cleavage over time,, certainly,, it's very important.
[1780.03 - 1784.47] But maybe I don't get exactly your question, maybe I maybe should tell you again.
[1785.43 - 1790.97] , if we want to make people better off, the world we live in, it has plenty of wealth
[1790.97 - 1796.57] and we observe many people who are not rich who have very high standards of living because they
[1796.57 - 1802.09] in the broad sense are educated, can enjoy amenities, can live in Paris or London on a limited
[1802.09 - 1807.81] income, take in what the city has to offer and doesn't that suggest that wealth inequality
[1808.59 - 1812.03] shouldn't really be the focus, it should be inequality of cultural capital.
[1812.93 - 1816.49] Yeah,, I think all of these are important because, if you only have
[1817.13 - 1822.29] high cultural capital, living in Paris or London is going to be difficult,, given the
[1822.29 - 1829.31] rent level.I think you want to care about both.And,, I care a lot about making
[1830.01 - 1836.01] access to education more egalitarian and,, as I told you,, France,,
[1836.21 - 1841.43] there's a lot of inequality and a lot of hypocrisy everywhere in terms of access to education
[1841.43 - 1845.99] in France., the US,, you have all this work by your restricting and analysis,
[1846.13 - 1851.77] , showing the relation between the parental income, person type and,, access to
[1851.77 - 1858.47] your education, the level of hypocrisy about,, the claims that are being made about equal
[1858.47 - 1863.87] opportunity and blah, blah, blah,, when you look at what you see in the data,,
[1863.89 - 1867.87] we have very far from that, but, there's a lot of hypocrisy everywhere in terms of,
[1867.87 - 1872.43] , unequal access to education in my country in France,, we put three times more
[1872.43 - 1880.45] public resources in the elite schools where more socially advantage students go to
[1881.01 - 1886.99] than in the normal universities schemes where more socially disadvantage students tend to go
[1886.99 - 1892.81] to.,, through public funding, you sometimes you magnify initial inequalities
[1892.81 - 1899.65] resources and reviews.There's enormous hypocrisy everywhere in terms of, and to me,,
[1899.71 - 1906.93] making more effective equality in access to education is absolutely essential.That being said,
[1906.93 - 1916.67] I also want to redistribute wealth and inheritance and property because,, if you only have
[1916.67 - 1924.11] high education, but you have no wealth at all,, it's more complicated, it's more complicated
[1924.11 - 1930.05] to value your own for your family, or, it's more complicated to start up a business, it's more,
[1930.05 - 1936.43] ,, if you look at the,, in the long run, there's been a movement to have more
[1936.43 - 1943.85] equality of income, labor income,, through educational expansion, through more labor rights,
[1944.33 - 1950.01] but if you look at the distribution of wealth,, what's very striking is that,
[1950.37 - 1956.67] okay, the top 10% wealth share has declined in the long run,, it used to be 80, 90% of the
[1956.67 - 1963.45] total is a 19th century in Europe, today it's more 50, 60% in Europe, in the US it would be more
[1963.45 - 1969.97] 60, 70%, people can disagree about the details, but these are really details as compared
[1969.97 - 1976.27] to this order of magnitude.Now, this decline in the very top 10% wealth share,, has been
[1976.27 - 1983.75] mostly to the benefit of the next 40%, which is already good, but if you look at the bottom 50%
[1983.75 - 1989.15] of the distribution,, they have, they have two percent of total wealth in the US,
[1989.51 - 1994.69] they have four percent in Europe or in a country France, it's a big better than two percent,
[1994.83 - 1999.77] but they have nothing, if you take in particular,, the bottom 50% children,
[2000.39 - 2008.35] , generation in France today or in the US today, they receive nothing at all
[2009.01 - 2015.27] in inheritance and where as a top 10% children will receive,, 60, 70% of the total.
[2016.19 - 2021.31] Now, I see this is, we are very far to say the list from the equality of opportunity,
[2021.65 - 2026.37] this is the list you can say, which is interesting because, equality of opportunity,
[2026.67 - 2031.77] , is sociological concept that people very often say they are in favor of it,
[2031.77 - 2039.11] but if you try to move in a concrete manner toward more equality of opportunity, for instance,
[2039.31 - 2045.35] by redistributing inheritance,, people get completely crazy and say, oh, how could you do that?
[2045.61 - 2052.19] ,, I'm making proposals about this in my recent books,, saying, okay,
[2052.83 - 2059.03] maybe,, everybody at age 25 should receive a minimum inheritance.Let's say,,
[2059.93 - 2067.33] 60% of average wealth,,, in France today, that would be 120,000 euros,,
[2067.33 - 2073.75] if the average wealth is 20,000,000 euros per adult, everybody say it would receive 120,000
[2073.75 - 2081.43] euros at age 25.Now,, this is still, people who today receive zero would receive 120,
[2081.43 - 2087.13] they would receive euros at age 25.Today, people who today receive one million would still receive
[2087.13 - 2092.83] 600,000,, after the progressive taxation of inheritance and wealth that's paying for that.
[2093.19 - 2099.27] , we are still, we would still be very, very far from equality of opportunity, and,,
[2099.31 - 2107.65] if you want my opinion, I think we should go beyond that.But just doing that,, would
[2108.23 - 2115.01] increase,, the share of about 50% children in total inheritance, which today,,
[2115.03 - 2122.05] is between two percent in the US, four percent in France,, it will be 20 to 25%
[2122.05 - 2128.47] which,, is still much less than 50% because, after all, there's also 50% children.
[2129.11 - 2135.41] But it will be, I think it will make a big difference in terms of real opportunity,,
[2135.41 - 2144.29] to start a business, but also,, more generally,, wealth has big impact on your
[2144.29 - 2150.25] bargaining power in life.,, when you, when you don't own anything, when you just own zero,
[2150.45 - 2158.67] or when you only have debt,, you have to accept everything.You have to accept any working
[2158.67 - 2164.23] condition, any wage, any job, because,, you need to pay for your bills, you need to pay for
[2164.23 - 2168.75] your rent, you should have a family, you need to,, to do something and to, you have to
[2168.75 - 2175.57] accept anything., when you have 100 or 200 or 300,,, for people who have millions or
[2175.57 - 2180.51] billions, maybe 100 is zero,, they don't make the difference, but for people who are
[2180.51 - 2186.69] zero,, having 100, 200,, put you in a position in terms of bargaining power,
[2186.95 - 2192.15] that is the rest of society, it's very different.And I think it's very complementary to cultural
[2192.15 - 2199.35] capital and human capital, because,, if you,, 100, 200, there's some euro,
[2199.51 - 2205.15] okay, that's not going to make you buy an apartment in Paris, that's not enough, but there are many
[2205.15 - 2211.51] other cities which,, for many people are more enjoyable, where you can buy an
[2211.51 - 2218.73] apartment or a house, you can start a business, it makes a real difference for a bottom 60% people.
[2218.73 - 2225.25] If I visit every major country in Europe, what I observe is the highest living standard is
[2225.25 - 2230.53] arguably in Switzerland, Norway and Luxembourg aside.Switzerland has one of the smallest
[2230.53 - 2236.99] governments and they attempt relatively little redistribution.What is your understanding of Switzerland?
[2237.27 - 2240.07] What if someone said,, Europe should try to be more Switzerland, they're doing great.
[2240.33 - 2246.39] Why is that wrong?Oh,, Switzerland,, it's a very small country,,,
[2246.39 - 2250.37] it's about the size,, it's smaller than the Île-de-France,, which is Paris
[2250.37 - 2257.81] region.Now, if you were to make a separate country out of Île-de-France,, GDP per capita,
[2257.99 - 2262.73] I think would be higher than Switzerland's land.And,, of course, you can always,
[2264.01 - 2270.37] , you can take a wealthy region in your country and say, okay,, I don't want to share
[2270.37 - 2275.97] anything with the rest of the country, I'm going to kick my tax for you for me.I'm going to be
[2275.97 - 2282.99] tax-event based on bankruptcy, and, that's going to make you 10 or 20 percent richer.
[2283.31 - 2286.93] , I'm not saying all the time.But it's been a long time since Switzerland relied on
[2286.93 - 2292.73] bank secrecy,?Following 9-11, that Swiss advantage largely went away.Oh, that's wrong.
[2293.13 - 2298.29] Oh, you're wrong on this.No, it's the UF that's the secrecy haven't.Yeah,, it's,
[2298.29 - 2303.49] no, it's still, it still brings a, no, no, I can tell you,, the banking sector and,
[2303.49 - 2310.19] , the status as a tax-event, it still brings an additional income of,, at least 10 or
[2310.19 - 2314.87] 20 percent to Switzerland.But I agree with you,, Switzerland will still be rich,,
[2314.93 - 2321.73] even without this.But there will be a bit poorer and they will certainly not be richer than,,
[2321.77 - 2326.89] if you compare to say the Paris region, GDP per capita,, the London region, or,,
[2326.95 - 2331.73] if you take the wealthiest region.You have to compare,, it's important to compare,
[2331.73 - 2337.63] , countries of comparable size, regions of comparable size.You mentioned Norway,,
[2337.77 - 2344.93] again, Norway, without the oil, will be more comparable to Sweden or Denmark, in terms of GDP per
[2344.93 - 2351.49] capita.Now the oil is making them richer, but,, I think this oil should remain
[2351.49 - 2357.91] in the ground.And,, I don't know if you've seen this incredible TV series Occupy, which
[2357.91 - 2363.93] today is what's happening in Ukraine,,, you can,, this is a series where
[2363.93 - 2368.87] Russia invades Norway in order to restart the oil production in order to make the European
[2368.87 - 2373.99] Commission happy and the European Commission looks as ugly as it can possibly look, which,
[2375.71 - 2381.75] unfortunately,, it's some time an accurate description where,,,
[2381.75 - 2386.77] , oil production is important that you're ready to, to,, in effect, to
[2386.77 - 2393.45] write things that, in fact, you should not, to,, but,, this was just a, and aside,
[2393.85 - 2399.45] not about Norway, but,, all,, it's being an important role.Luxembourg, okay,,
[2400.23 - 2407.03] Luxembourg, benefit a lot from, it's,, Switzerland is a real country with a diversified
[2407.03 - 2411.63] amount of money.Yeah, sure.Very little of it is a virus.The Paris region, the real region,
[2411.79 - 2416.21] yes, that's a clustering effect within France, France is much poorer than Switzerland.
[2416.77 - 2422.25] Could not France brings with prosperity.This is not comparable in size,, it's,
[2422.91 - 2428.09] , you can, I don't think it makes sense.Again, if you want to compare region of about
[2428.09 - 2433.51] 5, 10 million inhabitants,, which is the size of Switzerland, you'll find many other
[2433.51 - 2444.09] regions with comparable GDP per capita all across Europe., yeah, but,, there are
[2444.09 - 2448.79] many good things it's free, by the way,, I think,, the local democratic system,
[2448.99 - 2455.07] , has lots of good aspects to it,, the education system as.,,
[2455.11 - 2460.73] I'm not,, I think there's a lot to learn from each of this experiment.,
[2460.81 - 2466.57] the US,, has a much more better man than Sweden or Denmark or France, but,,
[2466.57 - 2471.45] I think there's a lot to learn historically from the US in terms of, including in terms of equality,
[2471.45 - 2479.59] and I think the enormous educational advance that was there in the US,, in the 19th
[2479.59 - 2487.33] century, in the middle of the 20th century,, is key to understand many of the issues I
[2488.09 - 2494.53] , I refer to.Now,, the case of Norway shows that,, you can also have a
[2494.53 - 2503.25] very,, very generous welfare state and,, that certainly does not prevent you from
[2503.25 - 2509.73] being, from being prosperous.Look, at the level of Europe,, we have 27 countries in the
[2509.73 - 2516.85] European Union.If you look, in terms of tax to GDP ratio,, the countries with the lowest
[2517.49 - 2524.01] tax to GDP ratio are Bulgaria and Romania.The countries with the highest tax to GDP ratio
[2524.01 - 2529.53] are Denmark and Sweden.,, if it was enough, in order to become rich to have a small
[2529.53 - 2534.11] government,, Bulgaria and Romania will be richers and Denmark and Sweden.,,
[2534.21 - 2539.39] we know that things are more complicated and it depends what you do with your tax revenue.
[2540.01 - 2546.51] ,, if you use it, then,, it's obvious from this evidence that this
[2546.51 - 2553.31] is complementary with high prosperity.Now, you've been awarded a Legion of Honor, but you turn
[2553.31 - 2559.13] that down if I understand correctly on the grounds that you don't trust or don't want government
[2559.13 - 2564.63] handing out status.If you do not entirely trust governments to hand out status, why trust them
[2564.63 - 2569.71] much to redistribute all this wealth?, what's the political economy constraint on that -three
[2569.71 - 2573.85] distribution process where you say, look, this isn't going to go the way I want it to go.
[2574.79 - 2580.13] No, this is because,, I believe in anonymous rules,, I believe,,
[2580.13 - 2585.69] I believe in it's not a belief,, it's not a religious belief or a religious faith.
[2585.91 - 2592.35] And I study history and I see that,, government under certain conditions have been
[2592.35 - 2600.21] able to develop a public education system, public health system, tax administration,,
[2600.45 - 2608.27] following anonymous rules, which have been working pretty and which we can improve, we should
[2608.27 - 2615.89] improve.What I've been deciding on an individual basis,, who is honorable, who is not
[2615.89 - 2620.61] honorable,, it's a very different business.And I think indeed that,,
[2620.73 - 2626.75] government are not elected to do these things.But how do you keep the anonymous,
[2627.05 - 2631.87] how do you keep the anonymous, how do you keep the anonymous rules anonymous,?They're slippage.
[2632.39 - 2635.37] It's not something you can easily write into a constitution.
[2637.15 - 2643.33] Yeah, but again, if I look at, the history of state construction and welfare state
[2643.33 - 2649.51] development in Sweden or France or Germany,, I don't see what episode you have in mind,
[2649.71 - 2656.25] exactly.What would be the,, in the United States, France for that matter, most countries,
[2656.43 - 2662.05] there's plenty of corruption.There are people, companies that get privileges due to tariffs,
[2662.05 - 2668.91] due to policy.Oh, sure, sure.Yeah.But it doesn't stay anonymous.Why trust the government
[2668.91 - 2677.85] much to redistribute wealth?No, sorry, sorry.I didn't.The correction you had in mind is it in
[2677.85 - 2683.63] the government of Sweden or France or Germany or is it in the private companies or is it?I think
[2683.63 - 2690.03] it's both.It's maybe higher in France and America than in Sweden.It's relatively high in Germany
[2690.03 - 2695.39] .You have Shorota, he's put on the board of Gazprom, but you can't say Germany isn't corrupt,
[2695.57 - 2699.61] ?, but this is when you joined the private sector.It was not when he was in government.
[2700.59 - 2705.27] Clearly, they were buying the services of people in German government,?Yeah, but that's
[2705.27 - 2710.09] because the example of the mantra is very important because it's exactly,,
[2710.31 - 2715.13] the example where in fact, as, when you run in government, I don't think any of these
[2715.13 - 2720.49] people,, when they run, they're not took money., the problem is if you let them
[2722.23 - 2730.27] go in the private sector and,, and join the,, this completely insane
[2731.33 - 2735.71] level of remuneration that you observe in the private sector.This is the problem.
[2736.41 - 2742.25] But I don't think,, in any of this country,, give me an example of a political leader
[2742.25 - 2750.15] who became billionaire by taking money when he was in office,, I don't know.I don't know
[2750.15 - 2754.35] anything.I think they sell their votes a much more cheaply than that., most of US Congress
[2754.35 - 2760.59] is quite happy to pass special interest favoring legislation.They don't get a billion dollars
[2760.59 - 2767.71] for their vote.Maybe that's a big deal.The perversity and,, the bad incentives,,
[2767.71 - 2773.65] come from the private sectors in all these examples, not the public sector where you have
[2773.65 - 2779.29] salary scale,, which, which,, in some cases could be, could be reduced further,
[2779.49 - 2786.69] but which are in general much more reasonable than in the, in the private sector as far as I can see.
[2787.51 - 2793.91] You've argued, France should pay reparations to Haiti.As I understand it, Haiti does not now
[2793.91 - 2798.97] really have a -functioning government.Should France still pay?Should France wait?What's your view?
[2801.27 - 2807.31] Yeah, I think,, I think, yeah, I think France should pay.,, let me just
[2807.31 - 2814.45] summarize, remind the story very quickly., this is an example where, when Haiti became
[2814.45 - 2822.61] independent and when the French state recognized finally in 1825, the independence of Haiti,
[2822.61 - 2830.15] knew the French state said, okay, we are going to recognize your independence only if you pay us
[2830.77 - 2839.89] huge amount of money, which was equivalent of 300 percent of GDP of Haiti of 1825, in order to
[2839.89 - 2846.65] compensate,, the French slave owners for their loss of property.This, of course, was
[2846.65 - 2853.05] impossible to repay in one year or in a few years., French bankers came, refinanced the debt,
[2853.23 - 2859.69] and in the end, the debt was repaid until the 1950s., you have payment to the bank of
[2859.69 - 2867.49] France until 1957.And,, there was many renegotiations.US was involved in the process,
[2867.49 - 2873.87] at some point, some of the debt was resolved by the French bankers to a consortium of US
[2873.87 - 2881.25] bankers.But, to make a long story short,, Haiti effectively repaid between 1825
[2881.25 - 2891.11] and 1957.,, almost a century and a half an enormous public debt in order in effect
[2891.11 - 2896.17] to compensate the French slave owners for their loss of property.I think it is impossible
[2896.89 - 2904.59] to say today, okay, this is too old.We don't care because,, there are reparations
[2904.59 - 2912.25] that are being made today for expropriation and values injustices that took place during World War
[2912.25 - 2919.65] 2 or sometime during World War 1., if you say for Haiti, this is too late, and for this
[2919.65 - 2924.81] other reparation or expropriation during World War 2, we can still do reparation.I think you have
[2924.81 - 2931.41] a problem because then it makes it very difficult,, to develop a language of neutrality,
[2931.71 - 2938.15] of justice upon which we can build,, future.I wouldn't say it's too late, but won't the
[2938.15 - 2942.91] money just go into private bank accounts and it will increase wealth inequality in precisely
[2942.91 - 2947.97] the way you object to?Oh, that's certainly not what I am proposing.,, what I am
[2947.97 - 2957.63] proposing is,, of course, that whenever there is a transfer for reparation or for
[2957.63 - 2965.19] development aid or whatever you want, we need to have a very strict monitoring of individuals
[2966.21 - 2972.05] who might get rich or get the money about this and whether they are in the public sector,
[2972.05 - 2977.75] in the private sector, wherever they are,, we should be very strict about that.And,
[2977.91 - 2983.43] , that's for sure., this isn't that reimposing a colonialism on Haitian
[2983.43 - 2988.93] government.If the French are going to monitor where all the money flows within Haitian government,
[2989.35 - 2992.93] that would require establishing quite a bit of sovereignty over Haiti.
[2994.53 - 3000.27] Yeah,, I think, I think, I think there are lots of people in Haiti,,
[3000.27 - 3006.27] who would to monitor how this money is being used.Look,, I'm not saying this is simple,
[3006.67 - 3011.03] but, reparations are never simple., I can tell you,, in my country,
[3011.55 - 3019.09] you were too late until 1999, 2000.,, almost only 20 years ago, for an official
[3019.09 - 3027.11] commission to look seriously at post-World War II reparation and, Jewish expropriation
[3027.11 - 3032.95] during war.,, this process takes time.If you look in the US, remember,,
[3033.07 - 3040.95] you have to wait until 1998 to see a low, adopted by US Congress,, to have reparations for
[3040.95 - 3045.23] the Japanese American, which as, were in turn during war.And during many decades,
[3045.91 - 3051.05] , people were saying, oh, that's impossible.That's too complicated.Where are we going to
[3051.05 - 3056.41] draw the line?Where are we going to stop?How can you decide the amount?And look, I understand,
[3056.41 - 3065.19] these are complicated decisions to be made.Now, is this the reason to,, forget about it
[3065.19 - 3070.29] and say, okay, we don't care anymore.I don't think.I think this will be the worst answer.
[3070.57 - 3075.57] , I fully recognize the complexity of the task., I'm certainly not trying to say this is
[3075.57 - 3085.03] easy, et cetera.But,, I reiterate my claim that if you abandon any attempt,,
[3085.03 - 3092.83] for justice, then you are in a very difficult situation to prepare the future.Because then,
[3092.93 - 3097.93] , people will tell you, okay,, you care about,, this expropriation
[3097.93 - 3102.93] and injustices, but you don't care about this, because you're kind., you have to try to develop
[3102.93 - 3111.97] some universal approach to justice in terms of objective criteria, including the destruction of
[3111.97 - 3118.03] gun to destruction of whales access to a negation.I don't know any other approach.
[3118.81 - 3124.13] I know you're very much a European federalist.And in at least one interview, you argued that the
[3124.13 - 3128.59] major countries in the current European Union should, in a sense, succeed and set up their
[3128.59 - 3135.91] own arrangements, part of which would redistribute more wealth.Would the net actual effect of that
[3135.91 - 3141.47] not be to greatly weaken the European Union we have now?You would have multiple tiers.
[3142.03 - 3149.85] Or how was that going to work?, first of all, I have been involved in writing this manifesto
[3149.85 - 3156.95] for the democratization of Europe.And we have made,, with a very large group of
[3156.95 - 3161.87] scholars from all over Europe,, lawyers, political scientists, economists, we have been
[3161.87 - 3168.87] proposing concrete changes in the treaties that organize the European Union.,, we're
[3168.87 - 3174.63] we're making very concrete proposals on how,, improving the work of the European Union.
[3174.83 - 3180.89] And indeed,, I am a European federalist.I am a European, what I call social federalist,
[3180.95 - 3188.89] in the sense that,, I want federalism to be able to deliver more social justice, to deliver more
[3189.57 - 3193.61] popular support to Europe, which,, today is not exactly the case., if you look at
[3193.61 - 3199.73] the Brexit vote,, the lower income groups voted to exit, upper income groups and upper
[3199.73 - 3204.43] education groups voted to stay.,, I think there's something wrong going on.,
[3204.49 - 3209.67] I think we need a different Europe, which brings more social justice, fiscal justice.
[3210.13 - 3215.65] And I think one of the solutions, certainly not the only one,, is to be able to make a
[3215.65 - 3222.95] majority rule decision-making over taxation., I think,, the problem today is
[3222.95 - 3229.45] that if Luxembourg wants to their put their veto,, taxation of multinationals or taxation
[3229.45 - 3235.17] of billionaires in Europe, then you cannot do anything together.In spite of the fact that,,
[3235.29 - 3241.41] Luxembourg, who is 300, there was an inhabitants, he's,, less than 0.1 percent of the
[3241.41 - 3246.21] population of the European Union, which you were 500 million.,, it's even less than
[3246.21 - 3253.85] the mobility in France in 1789, where the mobility was about 1 percent of the population and they had
[3253.85 - 3259.39] a bit of a word about taxation.I'm saying,, this cannot continue for very long.In
[3259.39 - 3264.53] the proposal we've been making,, it's not, what I want to say regarding your question is
[3264.53 - 3270.23] that it's not open only to large countries,, it's also open to every country in the
[3270.23 - 3274.87] European Union or even,, outside the European Union, which may want to join
[3275.57 - 3281.43] at some point.,, I'm just saying, I'm just saying that,, if you take Germany,
[3281.73 - 3287.61] France, Italy, Spain,, these four countries make almost 80 percent of the population
[3287.61 - 3293.75] and GDP of the Eurozone.,, if these four countries are ready to go,, I think
[3293.75 - 3298.39] they should go.They should try to convince as many other countries as possible, but,,
[3298.39 - 3305.83] I think the current arrangement where officially we have the unanimity rule for all fiscal and
[3305.83 - 3310.79] budgetary matters.And then,, remember,, what happened last year with the
[3310.79 - 3319.51] Covid post-COVID recovery plan in effect, France and Germany put much pressure on the Netherlands,
[3319.89 - 3326.25] Sweden, etc.That in the end, there was unanimity to have common borrowing and the recovery plan.
[3326.25 - 3331.79] But in a way, this was a fake unanimity, which,, there's a risk that, in the end,
[3331.79 - 3336.93] you make everybody unhappy because people who are forced to agree in effect, what happened is
[3336.93 - 3341.25] that France and Germany told the Netherlands and Sweden, okay, if you don't want to come in,
[3341.73 - 3346.77] we're going to have a separate arrangement between us and we will do it without you.,
[3346.87 - 3351.63] this side, okay, we will do it with you.But I don't think this is the way to organize
[3352.19 - 3358.19] political decisions.I think we should have a majority rule decision making and not based on
[3358.19 - 3364.01] country against country,, that's why,, the proposal we are making in the manifesto
[3364.01 - 3369.01] for the democratic solution of Europe is to have a European assembly where members of national
[3369.01 - 3376.59] parliament will come and be in front of each other.They will be there in proportion to the
[3376.72 - 3382.48] population of each country and in proportion to the size of each political group in each country.
[3383.48 - 3387.76] that,, it's not just country against country because,, when you have the
[3387.76 - 3392.34] head of state of Germany, the head of state of France, the head of state of Sweden, or the minister
[3392.34 - 3397.88] of finance of Germany, France and Sweden, when you have only one individual to represent the
[3398.72 - 3406.02] supposed interest of 18 million Germans or 65 million French, it's a machinery
[3406.72 - 3410.44] to make national interest against national interest whereas in fact,,
[3410.56 - 3415.74] within Germany or within France or within the Netherlands, people disagree, obviously, they have
[3415.74 - 3420.82] different political leaning., and I think the Europe, the current European parliament is not
[3420.82 - 3427.68] enough because in the end, it's really the national parliament, the German Bundestags, the French
[3427.68 - 3435.42] Assembly National who have the political legitimacy to make their tax payer,, pay more or less
[3435.42 - 3440.54] tax and to take budgetary decisions.Today, we are in this French situation where each national
[3440.54 - 3447.72] parliament has in effect a veto power on an all budgetary and fiscal decision.And indeed, I think
[3447.72 - 3454.70] one way to put beyond that is to put these national parliament members together,,
[3454.74 - 3459.36] maybe one week per month,, in the European Assembly to vote over budgetary decision.
[3459.36 - 3466.00] Now, what will come out of this?I don't know, but, I trust democracy.I think it could
[3466.00 - 3472.58] bring more social justice and fiscal justice if I just take one example, which is corporate
[3472.58 - 3481.14] taxation.Remember that the US until Trump,, had a federal corporate tax rate of,,
[3481.24 - 3486.66] 35% and,, in addition, that's the state corporate tax rate whereas in Europe,
[3487.30 - 3495.16] corporate tax competition had led,, corporate tax rate to go to our 20-10, etc.
[3496.56 - 3502.40] Which is very paradoxical in a way.The fact that Europe has led the movement to have more
[3502.40 - 3507.28] tax competition and corporate taxation because Europe has a bigger welfare state to pay for us
[3507.28 - 3512.88] in the US.And I think this shows that political institution for the fact that you have federal
[3513.74 - 3518.86] corporate tax and you can tax in the US, but not in Europe, make a difference.And I think
[3518.86 - 3524.72] if there was,, that's,, we could talk a lot more about this, but that's
[3524.72 - 3529.76] my view.If we really want to limit wealth inequality, why shouldn't the European Union
[3530.32 - 3536.26] let in as immigrants?Many, many more non-Europeans.Won't that just limit wealth inequality almost
[3536.26 - 3542.10] overnight?, is that a good idea?I don't think you endorse it in your book, but that seems to
[3542.10 - 3547.56] me by far the easiest and most direct way to limit wealth inequality.You mean to reduce
[3547.56 - 3553.48] wealth inequality at the world level?Sure, there's poor people all over the world including
[3553.48 - 3559.64] in former French colonies and take many more into the EU.Yeah, no, but, look, I am
[3559.64 - 3566.12] in charge of more migration and more open borders and,, roughly speaking, I am in
[3566.12 - 3571.86] favor of more control of capital and capital flows and less control of labor flows.
[3571.86 - 3576.30] And what else today we do the opposite.We have completely free capital flows and know
[3576.30 - 3581.48] this call coordination about the corporate taxation or capital taxation and we have strong
[3581.48 - 3587.14] restriction of labor flows.But,, I think it's important to address the two issues
[3587.14 - 3594.62] together because if you only open labor flows without changing the regulation of capital and wealth
[3594.62 - 3601.08] taxation, then okay, you're going to reduce inequality in the sense that many people from the
[3601.08 - 3607.84] south might benefit.But you're going to increase inequality within the populations that they live
[3607.84 - 3614.40] in the north.And the big winners may be top people in the north, also,,
[3614.48 - 3618.22] top people in the south, but, bottom people in the north will lose.I think,
[3618.84 - 3624.52] , if you want to fair solution, you need to do exactly what you say, but together
[3625.14 - 3632.02] with,, redistribution of wealth and income and not only in the north, but,,
[3632.06 - 3637.94] also in the south.,, I think that's perfectly complementary with what I am saying.
[3638.68 - 3642.26] Last question.What do you think of Michelle Hullback and the Spok submission?
[3645.62 - 3651.76] This is too nihilistic for me., he has some talent., he makes me think a lot
[3651.76 - 3656.46] to Selin., Selin,, maybe I don't know if Selin, but of course, he's a
[3656.96 - 3663.28] novelist of,, the interwar period in France who wrote this incredible novel Voyage
[3663.28 - 3668.70] of the Landouin, which is an incredible novel by,, when he's, he tells us his experience
[3668.70 - 3673.70] about it during World War One and then after World War One, it goes to Africa, then it goes to Detroit.
[3674.22 - 3679.42] , he's completely desperate about the world.He's desperate about World War One.
[3679.42 - 3683.68] Of course, he's desperate about colonialism.He's desperate about capitalism in Detroit.
[3684.38 - 3689.88] He's completely nihilistic, but he has a lot of talent., I think World War One is a bit
[3689.88 - 3694.98] the same.He has a lot of talent,, I think he's not, but in terms of political views,
[3695.78 - 3701.28] , he's, yeah, to me, he's just very nihilistic., I had the opportunity to have
[3701.28 - 3707.22] debate with him and public discussion with him is, yeah, he's too nihilistic for me.
[3707.22 - 3714.30] ,, I believe we can, we can make the world better.I believe,, I believe,
[3714.90 - 3719.84] the problem is with institution, not with people.I think human beings,, are
[3721.06 - 3727.86] good, to speak.And just the institutions are not always at the level of the human beings.
[3728.16 - 3731.66] But,, partly because it's difficult, of course, to set up the institution,
[3731.66 - 3737.26] but we can learn from history.And,, I'm trained with my work,, to contribute
[3737.26 - 3744.16] to this collective process of learning from history and how to build better institution
[3744.86 - 3750.80] to have a better world.Thomas, thank you very much.Again, everyone, the new book is a brief
[3750.80 - 3754.10] history of equality.Thanks a lot, Pagna.
